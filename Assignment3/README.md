# Convnet for 3D shape classification


#### In this assignment I learned to use a deep learning package (matconvnet) in order to classify 3D shapes. 
#### I defined a convnet that takes as input rendered images of 3D shapes across different views, then trained it on a given shape database using the matconvnet package.
####  Finally, I used this trained convnet to predict the category label for each given test shape
